ðŸ“Š Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis (NLP Project)

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping brand reputation and sales. Manually analyzing thousands of reviews is time-consuming and inconsistent.
This project automates sentiment classification of Amazon reviews, helping businesses quickly identify negative feedback and improve customer satisfaction.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Amazon Fine Food Reviews (Kaggle)

Rows: ~568,000 reviews

Target Variable: Sentiment (Positive / Negative)

Features Used:

Score (1â€“5 stars, mapped to sentiment: 1â€“2 = negative, 3 = neutral (dropped), 4â€“5 = positive)

Text (review content)

ðŸ›  Methodology
Data Cleaning

Dropped neutral reviews for binary classification (positive vs negative).

Removed missing/blank values.

Cleaned text: lowercased, removed HTML, URLs, punctuation, and extra spaces.

Feature Engineering

TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams + bigrams, min_df=5, max_df=0.9, sublinear TF, stopwords removed).

Modeling

Baseline: Dummy Classifier (random guess based on class frequency).

Multinomial Naive Bayes: Classic text classifier.

Logistic Regression: Linear model with class balancing.

Model Insights

Logistic Regression achieved 95% accuracy with 91% recall for negatives, making it the best model.

Naive Bayes reached 93% accuracy but weaker negative recall (59%).

Baseline only managed 74% accuracy and failed on negatives.

Top Features

Positive words: delicious, excellent, perfect, tasty, amazing

Negative words: terrible, disappointed, waste, bland, awful

ðŸ“Œ Business Value

Flags negative customer reviews early â†’ businesses can act before churn or reputational damage.

Provides interpretable insights into what words drive sentiment.

Helps product and customer support teams focus on real pain points.

ðŸš€ Future Work

Extend to multi-class classification (positive / neutral / negative).

Experiment with Linear SVM and transformer models (BERT).

Build a Streamlit app for real-time sentiment prediction.
